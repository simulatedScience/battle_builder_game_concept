# Battle Builder Card Game

This project contains materials for a card game concept I am developing called Battle Builder (title subject to change). The game is currently in the conceptual phase.

## Mechanisms
* coop
* competitive
* deck-building
* simultaneous turns
* resource management
* strategy

## Core Idea
Players are a group of learning gladiators, fighting in an arena. They practice battles against various monsters where they team up to defeat them, then face each other to determine the strongest fighter.

During monster battles, two players cooperate to defeat the AI-controlled monster. Each player has a deck of cards that each include offensive and defensive actions. Players draw cards from their decks to form hands, then select cards to play each turn. 
The monsters have their own decks. Each time a monster is attacked, a defense card is drawn from its deck to determine how it responds. It also plays its own attack cards each turn.

## About this repository
This repository contains some write-ups about the game as well as code to simulate battles between different player strategies. The simulation is used to assist in the game design and balancing process.
